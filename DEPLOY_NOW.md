# Deploy AcroEduvos to Production

## ✅ Code Changes Pushed to GitHub

All your interactive website updates have been committed and pushed to:
- **Repository:** https://github.com/samprati-s/acroeduvos-website.git
- **Branch:** main
- **Commit:** "Transform website to fully interactive with real-time data"

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (Automatic)

Since your repository is already connected to Vercel, the deployment should happen **automatically**. Vercel detects the push and deploys within 1-2 minutes.

### Check Deployment Status:

2. Find your **acroeduvos** project
3. You should see a new deployment in progress or completed
4. Click on it to see the deployment URL

### If Auto-Deploy Didn't Trigger:

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your **acroeduvos** project
3. Click **"Deployments"** tab
4. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
5. Or click **"Deploy"** button to trigger a new deployment

## 📊 Monitor Deployment

## 🐛 If Deployment Fails

If you see any errors in Vercel dashboard:

1. Check the build logs in Vercel
2. Most common issues:
   - Missing environment variables (not needed for this deployment)
   - Build errors (we tested locally, should be fine)
3. You can redeploy from the Vercel dashboard

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, share your live website:
- **acroeduvos.in** - Fully interactive coding platform
